## Code Explanation

### App Component

The `App` component serves as the root component and renders the `FlashCards` component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <FlashCards />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### FlashCards Component

The `FlashCards` component handles the main logic of the flash cards app.

```jsx
const questions = [
  {
    id: 3457,
    question: "What language is React based on?",
    answer: "JavaScript",
  },
  {
    id: 7336,
    question: "What are the building blocks of React apps?",
    answer: "Components",
  },
  {
    id: 8832,
    question: "What's the name of the syntax we use to describe a UI in React?",
    answer: "JSX",
  },
  {
    id: 1297,
    question: "How to pass data from parent to child components?",
    answer: "Props",
  },
  {
    id: 9103,
    question: "How to give components memory?",
    answer: "useState hook",
  },
  {
    id: 2002,
    question:
      "What do we call an input element that is completely synchronized with state?",
    answer: "Controlled element",
  },
];

function FlashCards() {
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);

  function handleClick(id) {
    setSelectedId(id !== selectedId ? id : null);
  }

  return (
    <div className="flashcards">
      {questions.map((question) => (
        <div
          className={question.id === selectedId ? "selected" : ""}
          key={question.id}
          onClick={() => handleClick(question.id)}
        >
          <p>
            {question.id === selectedId ? question.answer : question.question}
          </p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation of Main Functions

- **State Management:** 
  - `selectedId`: Manages the ID of the currently selected question.
- **handleClick Function:**
  - Toggles the visibility of the answer by setting `selectedId`.
  - If the clicked question is already selected, it hides the answer by setting `selectedId` to `null`.

## Styling

Ensure you have the appropriate styles defined in `styles.css` to style the flash cards and manage the selected state.

Example CSS:

```css
.flashcards {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.flashcards > div {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  cursor: pointer;
  width: 200px;
  text-align: center;
}

.flashcards > div.selected {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
